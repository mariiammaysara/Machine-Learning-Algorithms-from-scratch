# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) — From Scratch

This folder contains a full implementation of the **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)** algorithm without using scikit-learn.

##  Contents
- `knn.ipynb` — Clean, step-by-step notebook

##  What is KNN?
KNN is a simple, non-parametric machine learning algorithm that classifies a point based on the majority label among its **K nearest neighbors**.

### Steps:
1. Compute distances to all training points  
2. Select the K nearest  
3. Majority vote  
4. Return predicted label  

##  How to run
Just open `knn.ipynb` and run all cells.

##  Skills Learned
- NumPy vectorization  
- Understanding distance metrics  
- Basic ML classification logic  
- Train/Test splitting  
- Decision boundary visualization
